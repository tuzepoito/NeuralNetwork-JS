# JavaScript Neural Network

This is a JavaScript implementation of a [multi-layer Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron), also known as "artificial neural network".

This one example is inspired from the introduction on Neural Networks in the [CS231 class](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/) on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) at Stanford University, although this example is not a CNN, but a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron with one hidden layer. It takes 2-dimensional point coordinates as input and attempts to classify these points.
